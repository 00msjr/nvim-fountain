# Act 1

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A busy street in a metropolitan area. People hurry past each other, absorbed in their own worlds.

PROTAGONIST (30s, thoughtful, slightly disheveled) walks against the flow of pedestrians, noticing details others miss.

PROTAGONIST (V.O.)
They say the city never sleeps. Truth is, 
it's not even awake. Everyone's sleepwalking.

= This scene establishes our hero's outsider perspective

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Protagonist enters a cozy, independent coffee shop. It's a refuge from the chaos outside.

BARISTA
The usual?

PROTAGONIST
(nodding)
Thanks. Been a long morning already.

The Barista prepares an elaborate pour-over coffee with practiced precision.

BARISTA
You look like you've seen a ghost.

PROTAGONIST
Not a ghost. Just... a moment of clarity.

ANTAGONIST (40s, impeccably dressed, radiating confidence) enters the coffee shop, immediately commanding attention.

ANTAGONIST
(to Barista)
Espresso. Double shot.

Antagonist notices Protagonist and smiles with recognition.

ANTAGONIST
Well, well. Didn't expect to see you here.

PROTAGONIST
(tensing up)
Small world.

> FLASHBACK:

INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - TWO YEARS AGO - DAY

Protagonist and Antagonist in heated argument. Papers flying.

ANTAGONIST
You'll never work in this industry again!

> BACK TO PRESENT

ANTAGONIST
How's unemployment treating you?

PROTAGONIST
I prefer to call it "self-employment."

Protagonist takes their coffee and moves to leave.

ANTAGONIST
(calling after them)
You can't run forever!

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Protagonist exits, takes a deep breath, then notices something unusual across the street.

CUT TO:

INT. MYSTERIOUS LOCATION - NIGHT

A shadowy figure examines photographs spread across a table. We can't see their face.

Close-up on one photo: it's Protagonist at the coffee shop from earlier today.

SHADOWY FIGURE
(whispering)
Found you.

FADE TO BLACK.

> TITLE OVER BLACK: "48 HOURS EARLIER"

# Act 2

INT. PROTAGONIST'S APARTMENT - MORNING

A modest but personalized space. Books everywhere. Protagonist wakes up to a RINGING PHONE.

PROTAGONIST
(groggy)
Hello?

MYSTERIOUS VOICE (O.S.)
(through phone)
Check your email. You have one hour.

CLICK. Line goes dead.

Protagonist checks their laptop, opens an email. Their expression changes from confusion to shock.

PROTAGONIST
This can't be real.

On the screen: CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS with Antagonist's name all over them.

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
(to self)
What have I gotten myself into?

FADE OUT.

> THE END
